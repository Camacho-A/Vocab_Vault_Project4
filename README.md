# Vocab Vault

## Unit 4 - Full CRUD Application

### About Vocab Vault
As someone with dyslexia I have always struggled with low self-esteem, filled with worry about being "found out" since my childhood. In school, I always figured out coping mechanisms as a workaround to the struggle I had with language and continue to utilize them to this day. I have always very consciously and intentionally looked up unfamiliar words and kept a running log of them. This has helped me to acquire new words and expand my working vocabulary as well as better comprehend text.

With dyslexia affecting 780 million individuals globally, many of whom do not receive a diagnosis or receive learning supports, it is imperative that tools that allow access to language be made available. It is my  hope that this app allows fellow dyslexics the opportunity to feel more comfortable with language and able to engage with any text they come across in their day to day lives.
